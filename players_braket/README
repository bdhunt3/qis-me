#  The Player's <Bra|Ket>
This is a project designed to show the accessibility and application that quantum computers will have in everyday life.
The Player's BraKet is a set of virtual Dungeons and Dragons dice. Unlike other virtual dice sets, the BraKet is powered
by a real quantum computer in the IBM network. It uses a simple algorithm to generate truly random numbers. 
I will be updating the BraKet as I move forward. In the coming few weeks expect to see improved error handling and 
upgraded customizability. My first goal will be to toggle the flavortext and create a repository of cached random
numbers. My goal for the original BraKet was to create a somewhat petty dice roller for the pedant player who demands 
truly random numbers in his tabletop game.  While true to style, this creates a somewhat impractical roller. For 
quickest rolling use the default backend. Currently, the BraKet uses no pseudorandom number generation for dice rolls. 
In the future, an option to use stored random numbers will be made available.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install  the requirements as found in requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


In addition to package requirements, to run the BraKet you will need an operable IBMQ account.
Please follow these [instructions](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/create-active-my-ibm-account) from IBM support to 
create your IBMQ account.

## Using the BraKet
The BraKet is designed to accept any combination of rolls and dice. Enter your requests in form:
xdyy, where 'x' is the quantity of requested dice, and 'yy' is the dice type.

Currently d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4 dice are supported.

To request a combination of dice enter the dice as: 'xdyy+ndmm+...+'

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
