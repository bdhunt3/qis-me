# qis-me
Hi all! I figured I'd try my hand at learning some more quantum computing. My plan right now is to work my way through IBM qiskit's tutorial while taking detours to some more interesting projects as they come. My planned format is a basic summary .py file for each project accompanied with a more detailed (and hopefully more insightful) jupyter notebook.

My background is in nuclear physics, but I have recently made the change to a quantum optics/information group. My motivation for this repository is to one: learn more about using NISQ technologies, and two: create a more in-depth exploration of Qiskit.

Thanks,
-B.D.
